CliniHealth is a healthcare website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering essential medical services. It includes yoga tips, fast ambulance services, an online medical store, doctor appointment booking, and an interactive map to locate nearby hospitals. This platform aims to enhance healthcare accessibility and convenience for users.
Developed a comprehensive healthcare website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to provide users with essential medical services:

Medical Store: Implemented an e-commerce module for browsing and purchasing medicines, with secure payment integration.
Doctor Appointment Booking: Built a real-time appointment scheduling system for patients to connect with doctors based on availability.
Ambulance Services: Designed an interactive map feature for booking emergency ambulance services with live tracking.
Yoga Classes: Integrated a registration and scheduling platform for online and offline yoga classes.
The project enhanced user accessibility with a responsive design, role-based authentication, and RESTful APIs for seamless interaction between components.
